microplate Readme
================

This package is designed to work with microplate data, specifically
produced by Gen 5 software (in my case running a Bio-Tek Synergy HT
plate reader). The basic functions of this package allow importing and
combining plates, applying standard curves, and viewing standard curve
statistics. This package is still in development, with more features
planned.
