This package is designed to work with microplate data, specifically produced by Gen 5 software (in my case running a Bio-Tek Synergy HT plate reader). The basic functions of 
this package allow importing and combining plates, applying standard curves, and viewing 
standard curve statistics. This package is still in development, with more features 
planned.

# Getting started
